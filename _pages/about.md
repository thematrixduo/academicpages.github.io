I am a Final-Year PhD Student in the Artificial Intelligence Group at University of Cambridge. I am supervised by Prof. [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and Prof. [Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/). I am a member of Churchill College. My PhD research focuses on developing novel Machine Learning methods for visual reasoning, in particular diagrammatic reasoning. Besides this I have also done research in many other topics, including Graph Neural Networks, Unsupervised/Self-Supervised Learning, AutoML, Image Understanding, Medical Imaging, Psychology, Neuroscience and Control Engineering.
